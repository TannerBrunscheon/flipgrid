# Code Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to get a better understanding of your web development and user
interface design abilities. You are tasked with providing a simple sign up form, where a user can
register for an imaginary service. The form is to include inputs for the user’s first name, email
address, and password.
A
Feel free to use any technologies with which you are most comfortable.

**View 1 - Sign Up**

The page is to include a header, help text, a form, and submit button. All three fields are
required to submit the form.


**View 2 - Confirmation**

Once the user successfully fills out the form, they are to be routed to a confirmation view. Here
the user is provided confirmation information utilizing their first name and email address.
Additionally, a “Sign In” button is presented, but does not require any functionality.

**Submission**

You can deliver your submission in a variety of ways. The preferred method is to host the code
on your Github, ideally with the history of commits while you were working through the
challenge. Other options would be a zipped folder hosted on OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive,
etc. Then, email your submission to **paul.conlin@microsoft.com** and
**nate.edwards@microsoft.com**.

Good luck!
